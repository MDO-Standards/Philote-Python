class ImplicitDiscipline(pmdo.Discipline):
    """
    Base class for implementing implicit disciplines in Philote.

    Implicit disciplines solve equations of the form R(inputs, outputs) = 0, where the outputs
    are implicitly defined by the inputs through residual equations. Unlike explicit disciplines
    that compute outputs directly, implicit disciplines require solving nonlinear equations
    to find outputs that satisfy the residual constraints.

    This class provides the framework for implementing implicit disciplines that can be served
    over gRPC and integrated with optimization frameworks like OpenMDAO. Subclasses must
    implement the required methods to define the residual equations, solving strategy, and
    derivative computation.

    Key Features:
        - Residual equation definition via compute_residuals
        - Implicit solving capability via solve_residuals  
        - Jacobian computation for optimization via residual_partials
        - Linear operator support for matrix-free methods via apply_linear
        - Automatic gRPC service generation
        - Integration with optimization frameworks

    Mathematical Formulation:
        For implicit disciplines, we solve: R(x, y) = 0
        Where:
        - x are the inputs (design variables, parameters)
        - y are the outputs (state variables, unknowns)
        - R is the residual function

        The goal is to find y such that R(x, y) = 0 for given inputs x.

    Typical Usage:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import philote_mdo.general as pmdo
        >>>
        >>> class QuadraticSolver(pmdo.ImplicitDiscipline):
        ...     def setup(self):
        ...         self.add_input('a', shape=(1,))
        ...         self.add_input('b', shape=(1,))
        ...         self.add_input('c', shape=(1,))
        ...         self.add_output('x', shape=(1,))
        ...
        ...     def compute_residuals(self, inputs, outputs, residuals):
        ...         a, b, c = inputs['a'], inputs['b'], inputs['c']
        ...         x = outputs['x']
        ...         residuals['x'] = a * x**2 + b * x + c
        ...
        ...     def solve_residuals(self, inputs, outputs):
        ...         a, b, c = inputs['a'], inputs['b'], inputs['c']
        ...         discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
        ...         outputs['x'] = (-b + np.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

    Attributes:
        _is_implicit (bool): Always True for implicit disciplines

    Notes:
        - All methods except __init__ must be implemented by subclasses
        - The discipline automatically supports both local and remote execution
        - Residual equations should be formulated such that R = 0 at the solution
        - Both forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation are supported
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize the implicit discipline.

        Sets up the base discipline and marks this as an implicit discipline type.
        Subclasses should call super().__init__() and then implement the required methods.

        Examples
        --------

        Compute residual equations R(inputs, outputs) that must equal zero.

        This method evaluates the residual functions given the current values of inputs
        and outputs. The residuals represent the constraint equations that must be
        satisfied: R(inputs, outputs) = 0. The goal of the implicit solver is to find
        output values that drive these residuals to zero.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs : dict
            Dictionary of input values with variable names as keys and numpy arrays as values
        outputs : dict
            Dictionary of current output values (current guess) with variable names as keys
        residuals : dict
            Dictionary to store computed residual values with variable names as keys.
            Must be populated by this method.

        Examples
        --------
        For a quadratic equation axÂ² + bx + c = 0:

        ...     residuals['x'] = a * x**2 + b * x + c

        For a system of coupled equations:

        Notes
        -----
        - Residuals should be zero at the solution
        - All output variables should have corresponding residual equations
        - Residual arrays must have the same shape as their corresponding outputs
        - This method is called during both residual evaluation and solving

        Solve the implicit equations to find outputs that satisfy R(inputs, outputs) = 0.

        This method implements the nonlinear solving strategy to find output values that
        drive the residuals to zero. The specific solving approach (Newton's method,
        fixed-point iteration, analytical solution, etc.) depends on the problem
        characteristics and implementation choice.

        - Partials are used for optimization, sensitivity analysis, and coupled solving
        - Consider finite differencing if analytical derivatives are too complex
